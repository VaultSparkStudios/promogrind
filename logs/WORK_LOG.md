### 2026-04-22 - Session 66 closeout

- Goal: repair startup/truth drift, complete the highest-leverage `/go` items, and leave the repo in a clean closeout-ready state.
- What changed: restored the missing startup helper, patched runtime-pack and local IGNIS fallback behavior for public-safe single-repo mode, rebuilt status/contracts/runtime surfaces, replaced template-grade context files with real project state, and patched startup-brief fallbacks so repo-local truth can render without fake zero-state metrics.
- Files or systems touched: `scripts/lib/human-action-ages.mjs`, `scripts/lib/runtime-pack.mjs`, `scripts/rescore-ignis.mjs`, `scripts/render-startup-brief.mjs`, `context/*.md`, `context/PROJECT_STATUS.json`, `context/contracts/*`, `context/runtime-pack/*`, `docs/STARTUP_BRIEF.md`, `docs/GENOME_HISTORY.md`, `docs/REVENUE_SIGNALS.md`, `ignis/output/*`.
- Risks created or removed: removed startup-brief hard failure and manifest/runtime-pack capability underreporting; remaining risk is protocol-genome weakness (`12/25`) and continued drift if broad repair scripts overwrite repo truth again.
- Recommended next move: start the product-side tranche by extracting `src/App.jsx` into a shell plus operator-loop modules, then unify workflows into one action graph with a stronger feedback loop.
