// audit-premises.mjs — S239 audit #8 · typed premise contract for audits
//
// THE DEFECT
//   The 2026-07-15 routine audit asserted "ten scheduled workflows remain" and
//   "the closeout cluster needs hardening" when S238 had already removed every
//   schedule and the cluster was green (blockingFailing 0). Studio Oracle's
//   preverify gathers TEXT evidence, but nothing encodes a CHECKABLE claim, so a
//   stale finding still reads as authoritative prose and reaches founder
//   attention. S239 hit this live again: item #14 asserted a 4.8MB access ledger
//   demanding rotation, while the live ledger-growth probe reported pass:true.
//
// THE CONTRACT
//   A premise is a typed, machine-checkable claim: what is asserted, which
//   adapter resolves it, and what value would make it TRUE. Evaluation returns
//   exactly one of:
//     verified     — evidence supports the claim
//     contradicted — evidence disproves it (the stale-finding case)
//     unverified   — no evidence resolvable (STAYS unverified; never auto-passes)
//
//   `unverified` is deliberately NOT a pass. An audit that cannot prove its own
//   premise must say so; silently treating unresolvable claims as true is the
//   exact failure this module exists to prevent.
//
// Pure by construction: adapters resolve against INJECTED data, never by
// shelling out, so premises are provable in fixtures with no live host.

  // S321 [audit #5] — A PREMISE THAT CANNOT BE TRUE TWICE.

  // the literal "backup 19". That probe reports a monotonically increasing backup
  // age: it read 19.7h when the premise was written and 23.5h by the next session.
  // The premise was true exactly once and can never be true again — and its decay
  // was published as `evidence DISPROVES the claim`, counted into "this audit is
  // stale — re-verify before acting", indistinguishable from a premise that was
  // simply wrong about the world.
  //
  // This is its own state, not a fourth meaning crammed onto CONTRADICTED. A
  // disproof carries information; this carries none, and a verifier whose strongest
  // verdict can fire on no information spends the reader's trust for nothing.

/**
 * Two ways an expectation binds itself to a number that moves on its own.
 *
 * (a) A DRIFTING TOKEN in the expected text: an ISO-8601 instant, or an age/duration
 *     quantity (`19.7h`, `1d`, `45s`). Deliberately narrow — a premise SHOULD be able
 *     to expect a plain count like `0` or `14`, which does not drift by itself.
 *
 * (b) A PINNED SUBSTRING OF FREE PROSE. The premise that motivated this used neither
 *     an ISO stamp nor a unit: it pinned `contains "backup 19"` against the `detail`
 *     field of a doctor probe. A probe's `detail` is a human sentence rebuilt on every
 *     run; pinning a substring of one that contains a digit is a bet on a measurement
 *     rendered inside prose, and it decays the moment the measurement moves. The rule
 *     is written from that exact text rather than from a tidier hypothetical, because
 *     a guard tested only on the case it was designed for is a guard tested on nothing.
